# Amino-Test
Its my version of Amino Test i had during recturation for a position in a certain company.
Based on the .tsv file, the program checks whether the given string of three letters is 
an amino acid and whether it exists in the file, as it writes its full name in the dictionary and 
adds the number of occurrences in the entire string that we check.
